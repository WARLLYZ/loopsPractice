// Make variable laps = 0; write a for loop that logs (“that’s another lap!”) and adds 1 to the laps variable. AFTER the loop, log laps.
// git add, commit, push
// Make variable age. Make a loop from 0-100. In every loop check if i == age, if so log something, else say “age doesn’t match”.
// Write a loop that logs all even numbers from 0-700.
// Write a loop that logs all odd numbers from 0-700.
// Write a loop with some “if else” statements. The loop should start at 1900 and go to 1949 and log when things were invented. For example when i = 1902 the code should log “it is 1902 - the teddy bear is invented!”
